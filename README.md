:warning: **Use at your own risk. I'm not responsible if you trash your account**. :warning:

(I'm not a dev so forgive the quick and dirty style ;))

## BIG thanks!

This won't be possible without:
* Finary keeping open its API ;)
* The great work of @lasconic for his Finary Unofficial API wrapper (https://github.com/lasconic/finary_uapi)
* The great work of RealT Community API (https://api.realt.community/)
* Exchange Rate API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com)
* The great idea from @MadeInPierre author of Finalynx, bringing an alternative for your Finary portfolio views and much more (https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx)

## Installation

Once you clone this repo, you need to install its dependencies:
```bash
cd finasync
poetry install
```
Copy paste the my_info.json.tpl file to my_info.json and file your Finary username and password (at least), and other personal data.

Run `poetry run python -m finasync signin`

Try `poetry run python -m finasync me`

If you get errors about being unauthorized, you need to signin again.

## Current integrated platform

**RealT**:

Fractional and frictionless real estate investing powered by the blockchain. If you don't already have an account, here is a referral link to sign up: https://realt.co/ref/nmathey/ 
RealT is a pionner in Real Estate applied to Web3.0 and very focus on its community.

Made possible thanks to RealT Community API (https://api.realt.community/) so you need an API Key to get full RealT token details.
Here is the form to get one: [Grant API access token](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf20z9fooLlq7tJTrUM4ESRlGRaqXun1wHLz5UscsF2xkdhfg/viewform)

Current working scope (tried to keep it simple for now):
- 	rentals properties only for now
- 	add/delete rentals own properties in Finary real estate rent category
- 	update properties values and monthly rent

Known limitations:
-	Gnosis network only
-	Single wallet only

Usage (once signin):
- For syncing as indvidual real estate property in "real estates" Finary category (API Key needed)
	`poetry run python -m finasync realt rent`

	To delete everything created with this command: `finasync realt rent deleteall`

- For syncing every each properties in "others assets" category (API Key NOT NEEDED but less properties details)
  	`poetry run python -m finasync realt other-detailed`

	To delete everything created with this command: `finasync realt other-detailed delete`

- For syncing as a single portfolio line in "others assets" category (API Key NOT NEEDED but way less details)
  	`poetry run python -m finasync realt other`

	To delete everything created with this command: `finasync realt other delete`

It will sync your RealT portfolio hosted on the blockchain to your Finary account.
