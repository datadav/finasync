## Installation

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. To set up your environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Install Poetry**  
   If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions from the official Poetry documentation: [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nmathey/finasync
   cd finasync
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```shell
   poetry install
   
4. **Fill your informations**  
Copy paste the **my_info.json.tpl** file to **my_info.json** and fill your informations
   ```shell
   cp my_info.json.tpl my_info.json

5. **Run**  
`poetry run python -m finasync signin`
or
`poetry run python -m finasync me`

You may be prompted to provide a two-factor authentication code during sign-in. If so, replace `YOUR_AUTH_CODE` with the code from your authenticator app:

```bash
poetry run python -m finasync signin YOUR_AUTH_CODE
```

If you get errors about being unauthorized, you need to signin again.

## Current integrated platform

**RealT**:

Fractional and frictionless real estate investing powered by the blockchain. If you don't already have an account, here is a referral link to sign up: https://realt.co/ref/nmathey/ 
RealT is a pionner in Real Estate applied to Web3.0 and very focus on its community.

Made possible thanks to RealT Community API (https://api.realt.community/) so you need an API Key to get full RealT token details.
Here is the form to get one: [Grant API access token](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf20z9fooLlq7tJTrUM4ESRlGRaqXun1wHLz5UscsF2xkdhfg/viewform)

Current working scope (tried to keep it simple for now):
- 	rentals properties only for now
- 	add/delete rentals own properties in Finary real estate rent category
- 	update properties values and monthly rent

Known limitations:
-	Gnosis network only
-	Single wallet only

Usage (once signin):
- For syncing as indvidual real estate property in "real estates" Finary category (API Key needed)
	`poetry run python -m finasync realt rent`

	To delete everything created with this command: `poetry run python -m finasync realt rent deleteall`

- For syncing every each properties in "others assets" category (API Key NOT NEEDED but less properties details)
  	`poetry run python -m finasync realt other-detailed`

	To delete everything created with this command: `poetry run python -m finasync realt other-detailed delete`

- For syncing as a single portfolio line in "others assets" category (API Key NOT NEEDED but way less details)
  	`poetry run python -m finasync realt other`

	To delete everything created with this command: `finasync realt other delete`

It will sync your RealT portfolio hosted on the blockchain to your Finary account.
